This in turn is causing an increased number of queries per second on the Mongo deployment.<br/>Handling more queries in a given time window causes Mongo to reply with increased latencies.  Since your shopping cart feature depends on the results from Mongo Atlas, this is the reason for slow response times on that feature of this project.<br/>\n\n```graph_line\n id-line-1 ~END~ \n```\n\n"
